# Analysis of Monthly Article Traffic for Wikipedia Pages

This repository contains the data files, code and results of this project. The goal of this project is to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset of monthly article traffic for a select set of pages from English Wikipedia from July 1, 2015 through September 30, 2023.

## Steps to Reproduce This Research

1. Install the required resources as listed in the Resources header above. 
2. Run the Monthly Article Traffic Analysis.ipynb file.
3. Analyze results.

## Data 

Source Files:
- [Movies List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A1h_7KAo7KXaVxdScJmIVPTvjb3IuY9oZhNV4ZHxrxw/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Sample API Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XjFhd3eXx704tcdfQ4Q1OQn0LWKCRNJm/view?usp=sharing). This code is provided under the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) [CC-BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Revision 1.2 - August 14, 2023

Intermediary Files:

- academy_monthly_mobile_start201507-end202309.json: Monthly mobile page traffic. 
- academy_monthly_desktop_start201507-end202309.json: Monthly desktop page traffic.
- academy_monthly_cumulative_start_201507-end202309.json: Monthly cumulative data is the sum of all mobile, and all desktop traffic per article.

Each JSON file is organised as an array of arrays. The larger array represents a single movie and the nested array within each larger array holds JSON objects that represent the pageviews for a particular month for that movie. The following is a description of each of the fields present in the JSON objects:

|Key name|Data Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`project`|`string`|the name of the project|
|`article`|`string`|the article(s) you want to retrieve data for|
|`granularity`|`string`|the granularity of data to return; "daily" or "monthly"|
|`timestamp`|`string`|The timestamp of the returned datapoint|
|`agent`|`string`|The type of agent that is considered when returning the number of views|
|`views`|`int`|The number of page views for the article at a timestamp that falls within the range for the given agent type|

## Special Considerations
- The API call takes a considerable amount of time. To account for lag, a try/except block of code has been added.
